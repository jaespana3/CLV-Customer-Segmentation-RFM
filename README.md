## Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) & RFM Analysis

This project analyzes user behavior using cohort-based CLV and RFM segmentation. The analysis is based on event-level data from the `turing_data_analytics.raw_events` table in BigQuery. The objective is to estimate long-term value for all users (not just purchasers) and segment them for strategic decision-making.

### Project Objectives

* Perform cohort-based **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** analysis over a 12-week period
* Calculate **weekly and cumulative ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)** per cohort
* Use **forecasting methods** to estimate revenue for recent cohorts
* Conduct **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** segmentation for customer profiling
* Visualize findings in spreadsheets and dashboards

### Deliverables

#### SQL Queries

* `CLV.sql` â€“ Identifies registration cohorts and calculates weekly ARPU
* `Cumulative CLV.sql` â€“ Computes cumulative ARPU over time
* `RFM.sql` â€“ Segments users based on recency, frequency, and monetary value

#### Supporting Files

* `RFM and CLV Projects.xlsx` â€“ Contains tables, charts, and formatting for CLV and RFM analysis
* Tableau Dashboard (RFM) â€“ Interactive visualization of RFM segmentation
